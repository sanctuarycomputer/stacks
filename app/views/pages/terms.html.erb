<p>Sanctuary Computer Inc operates the Stacks service, for internal use of their employees. If you use it, please use it responsibly. If you don&#39;t, we&#39;ll terminate your account.</p>
<p>The Terms of Service and the Stacks service itself can change at any time. We&#39;ll try to warn you about major changes to the Terms of Service or Stacks service, but we make no guarantees.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the basic idea, but You must read through the entire Terms of Service below and agree with all the details before You use any of our sites (whether or not you have created an account).</p>
